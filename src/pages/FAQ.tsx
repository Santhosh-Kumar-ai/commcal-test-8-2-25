                    Retention Rate = (1 - (churn $ / start book $))^12 <br/><br/>
                    This can also be seen as the inverse of your churn rate, annualised to be compared against your annualised retention targets.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    For example, if you start with $1000 in ARR and lose $10 to churn, your churn rate would be 1% and your retention rate would be 99% at a monthly/quarterly runrate. This when annualised (by using ^12) becomes 88.64%.

                  <p>
                    Your attainment is then calculated based on how your actual retention rate compares to your minimum and maximum targets on a linear scale.

                  <p>
                    These targets create a scale that determines your attainment percentage. For example, if your minimum target is 80% retention and your maximum is 90%, achieving 85% retention would put you at 50% attainment.
