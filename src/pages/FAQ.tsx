                    For example, if you start with ₹1,000,000 in ARR and lose ₹100,000 to churn, your retention rate would be 90%.

                  <p>
                    Your attainment is then calculated based on how your actual retention rate compares to your minimum and maximum targets on a linear scale.

                    <strong>Minimum Retention Target:</strong> This is the baseline retention rate you're expected to achieve. Falling below this target results in zero attainment for the retention component.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Maximum Retention Target:</strong> This is the ideal retention rate that represents 100% attainment. Achieving this rate or higher means you've fully met or exceeded your retention goals.

                  <p>
                    These targets create a scale that determines your attainment percentage. For example, if your minimum target is 80% retention and your maximum is 90%, achieving 85% retention would put you at 50% attainment. This creates a fair system that rewards incremental improvements in retention performance.
